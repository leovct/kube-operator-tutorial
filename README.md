## Introduction

This repository serves as a valuable reference for all tutorial followers aspiring to master the art of building Kubernetes Operators. Here, you will find the complete source code and resources used in the [articles](https://medium.com/@leovct/list/kubernetes-operators-101-dcfcc4cb52f6).

Below, you'll find the mapping of each tutorial article to its corresponding code directory.

Happy coding and learning! üöÄ

## Architecture Diagram

Here's the architecture diagram of the `Foo` operator that you'll design following the articles.

Note that it's a very simple operator which has no real use, except to demonstrate the capabilities of an operator.

## Differences between versions

Below are examples of `diff` outputs between different versions of the operator.

### `v1` <> `v2`

```diff
$ diff -r operator-v1 operator-v2
diff --color -r operator-v1/README.md operator-v2/README.md
1c1
< # operator-v1
---
> # operator-v2
diff --color -r operator-v1/api/v1/foo_types.go operator-v2/api/v1/foo_types.go

> 
>       // Foo's favorite colour
>       Colour string `json:"colour,omitempty"`
Only in operator-v2: color
diff --color -r operator-v1/config/crd/bases/tutorial.my.domain_foos.yaml operator-v2/config/crd/bases/tutorial.my.domain_foos.yaml
46a47,49
>               colour:
>                 description: Foo's favorite colour
>                 type: string
diff --color -r operator-v1/controllers/foo_controller.go operator-v2/controllers/foo_controller.go
32a33
>       color "my.domain/tutorial/color"

>       foo.Status.Colour = color.ConvertStrToColor(foo.Name + foo.Namespace)
```

### `v2` <> `v2-with-tests`

```diff
$ diff -r operator-v2 operator-v2-with-tests
diff --color -r operator-v2/README.md operator-v2-with-tests/README.md
